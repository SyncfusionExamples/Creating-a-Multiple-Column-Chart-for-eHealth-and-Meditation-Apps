# Creating a Multiple Column Chart for eHealth and Meditation Apps
Multiple column charts are commonly used in business analytics to compare sales performance across various products or regions. This sample demonstrates how to create a Multiple Column Chart by analyzing the revenue growth rates of eHealth and meditation apps in the US using .NET MAUI (SfCartesianChart).

According to the [Statista Health Market Insights study](https://www.statista.com/chart/29292/estimated-premium-option-in-app-purchase-revenues-of-ehealth-and-meditation-apps-in-the-us/), our chart shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to in-app purchases in medication checker and meditation apps, generating $1.2 billion in revenue in the United States in 2022. Joanne Kim, the researcher of the study, noted a 200% increase in telehealth app downloads between 2019 and 2020. It is projected that by 2027, the combined revenue from in-app purchases of mindfulness apps and medication checkers could reach nearly $2 billion.
