# Creating a Multiple Column Chart for eHealth and Meditation Apps
Multiple column charts are commonly used in business analytics to compare sales performance across various products or regions. This sample demonstrates how to create a Multiple Column Chart by analyzing the revenue growth rates of eHealth and meditation apps in the US using .NET MAUI (SfCartesianChart).

According to the [Statista Health Market Insights study](https://www.statista.com/chart/29292/estimated-premium-option-in-app-purchase-revenues-of-ehealth-and-meditation-apps-in-the-us/), our chart shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to in-app purchases in medication checker and meditation apps, generating $1.2 billion in revenue in the United States in 2022. Joanne Kim, the researcher of the study, noted a 200% increase in telehealth app downloads between 2019 and 2020. It is projected that by 2027, the combined revenue from in-app purchases of mindfulness apps and medication checkers could reach nearly $2 billion.

### Customizing the chart appearance
We have personalized the appearance of our chart by adding a chart title and legend, as well as customizing elements such as the plot area background, axis elements, series, etc.
#### Adding a chart title
Chart title will provide context to the data being plotted.
#### Adding a chart legend
The legend contains a list of series in the chart. Enabling the chart legend allows us to identify the corresponding data series in the chart.
#### Chart’s plot area background view customization
The SfCartesianChart allows you to add any view to the chart plot area. In this example, we’ll add a SfCircularChart to the background of the Cartesian chart.
#### Chart axis customization
Cartesian chart axes provide support for customizing the style of the axis lines. In this example, we have disabled the axis grid lines and hidden the axis line.
#### Chart series customization
The series’ appearance can be customized by assigning different fill colors to each series and enabling data labels for the series segments.
