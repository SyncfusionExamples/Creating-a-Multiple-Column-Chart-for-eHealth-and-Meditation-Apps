### Customizing Chart Appearance
In this example, we have customized the appearance of our chart by adding a chart title and legend, as well as personalizing elements such as the plot area background, axis elements, series.

#### Adding a chart title
A chart title provides essential context to the plotted data

#### Adding a Chart Legend
The legend contains a list of series in the chart. Enabling the chart legend allows us to identify the corresponding data series in the chart.

#### Customizing Chart Plot Area Background View
The SfCartesianChart allows you to add any view to the chart plot area. In this example, we'll incorporate an SfCircularChart as the background of the Cartesian chart.

#### Chart Axis Customization
We can further customize axis elements, including axis label style, major tickline style, axis line style, and the visibility of both axis and axis major gridlines.

#### Customizing Chart Series
The seriesâ€™ appearance can be customized by assigning different fill colors to each series and enabling data labels for the series segments.
